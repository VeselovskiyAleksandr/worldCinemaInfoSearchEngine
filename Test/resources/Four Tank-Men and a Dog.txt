Country: Polish,

Scriptwriter: Janusz Przymanowski, Stanislaw Wohl, Maria Przymanowska,
filmStudio: Zespol Filmowy Syrena,
Annotation: The series is divided into 21 episodes of 1 hour each. In the first 8 episodes, we follow Janek, Gustlik, Grigorij and their boss Olgierd from Oka (in 1943) to Gdansk (in March 1945).
The war is almost over, Olgierd dies, but then the series is resurrected for 13 more episodes that last barely a month (from March to May 1945).
Tomek Czeresniak joins the crew that fights German saboteurs on the Pomeranian seacoast and then joins the big offensive across the Odra river all the way to Berlin.
Generally speaking, the later episodes are slightly better than the earlier ones - the action scenes are more exciting, and Wieslaw Golas (playing Tomek) is way more fun than Roman Wilhelmi
(who plays Olgierd). Particularly exciting is the episode when the tank crew is taken prisoner by the Germans near the Odra river, and the Rudy tank is used as target practice on an artillery range.
The episode when the tank enters the flooded subway tunnels in Berlin is also very impressive,
