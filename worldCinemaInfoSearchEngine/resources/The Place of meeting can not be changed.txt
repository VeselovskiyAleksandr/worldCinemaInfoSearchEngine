Annotation: The film is set in post-war Moscow. Lieutenant Vladimir Sharapov (Vladimir Konkin) is a young reconnaissance officer who has just returned from the war and is assigned to peacetime service with the famous MUR. There he becomes part of an elite detective team led by Captain Gleb Zheglov (Vladimir Vysotskiy). The duo becomes embroiled in two seemingly unrelated investigations: that of the murder of young aspiring actress Larisa Gruzdeva, and the hunt for a brazen, vicious gang of armed robbers that calls itself The Black Cat and constantly manages to evade capture. While suspicion in Gruzdeva's murder initially falls on her estranged husband Dr. Gruzdev (Sergey Yurskiy), it gradually becomes obvious that the two cases are connected, as a Black Cat mobster Fox (Aleksandr Belyavskiy) is implicated in the murder. As a result of Zheglov's successful high - stakes operation to capture Fox, Sharapov inadvertently finds himself undercover at the Black Cat hideout, sparring with the gang's menacing leader, the Hunchback (Armen Dzhigarkhanyan),
